# Phase 3 Placeholder Metrics

The "Client Satisfaction" percentage displayed on the dashboard is currently hard-coded. It is intended as a placeholder metric for demonstration purposes.

In a future phase the client may provide survey data or a formula for calculating this value dynamically. The implementation should be revisited when those requirements are clarified.

## Analytics page

The dashboard now includes a **ðŸ“Š View Analytics** button linking to `/analytics`. This route displays a "Coming soon" message. Full reporting features are planned for Phase 5, so this button and page act as placeholders in Phase 3.
